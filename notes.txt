Hello all,

In order to prepare the next following classes, it is important to download and install:
Kali Linux 2.0 [1] natively or in a VM (if you install it in a VM, please manage to make the File Sharing working. There are some tutorials that explain this well)
Windows XP Virtual Machine [2].

To import the Windows XP Virtual Machine .ova file, you need to:
VirtualBox Manager => File => Import Appliance.
Go to the VM settings and disable USB 2.0 and the file shared under File Sharing.

Note: The "Kali Linux 64 bit LXDE" is very lite and adapted to low performance computers (it is my favorite version of Kali).

Thank you,
Adel
